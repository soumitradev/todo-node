# Todo in Node.js
Hi, this is my first Node.js project.

It uses the MEN part of the MERN stack.

I made a todo API complete with CORS and data validation, and a crappy front-end for the same.

Node.js is amazing.

Link will be here after I deploy.

Until then, you can read the API documentation [here](./docs) I guess.
