### Conventions:

- This API accepts and responds only with JSON requests.
- As of now, usage of this API does NOT require an API key
- As of now, this API does NOT have any form of Authentication or Ratelimiting
- This API is CORS enabled (obviously)
- The endpoints shown use curly brackets (`{}`) to mark a section of the request URL as replacable using parameters
- The content type of the request must be `application/json; charset=utf-8`.

### Response Codes:

- The only HTTP status codes this API responds with are:
  - 200: OK (For successful Updating, Reading, and Deleting)
  - 201: Created (For successful Creating)
  - 400: Bad Request (For when the request is invalid)
  - 404: Not Found (For when the resource requested is not found)
  - 500: Internal Server Error (For valid, but unsuccessful requests due to an internal error)

### Schema:

- The todo schema is as follows:
  - All string fields in this schema are trimmed for whitespace. i.e. Any trailing or leading spaces are removed before evaluation.
  - Every list has a title, a description (which is empty if not provided), an id (that may be custom or auto-generated), a private boolean which is true when the list is private, and a list of tasks that contains at least 1 and at most 100 tasks.
  - Every title is a string, and is at least 1 and at most 100 characters long.
  - Every description is a string, which is at most 400 characters long. If the description is not provided, it is assumed to be an empty string.
  - Every id is unique string, which is at least 1, and at most 40 characters long. Every id must match the regular expression : `/[\w\-]/i`. This can be provided, or autogenerated. If autogenerated, it is 10 characters long by default.
  - Every task is an object with 2 properties: A task body (which is optional), and a boolean done to indicate if the task is done.
  - The task body is a string, which is at most 200 characters long. If the body is not provided, it is assumed to be an empty string.
